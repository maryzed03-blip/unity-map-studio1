// live-broadcast.ts
// The single, unambiguous "is a class live right now" signal — lives in
// the Realtime Database (not Firestore), same pattern as presence.ts and
// for the same reason: RTDB's onDisconnect() lets the SERVER clear this
// automatically the instant a teacher's connection drops (browser closed,
// crashed, lost network), with zero reliance on any client-side cleanup
// code ever running. There is exactly one node — it either exists (a
// class is live) or it doesn't. Nothing to compare, nothing to guess.
//
// This deliberately does NOT replace liveSessions/groupRooms in Firestore
// — those remain the durable source of truth for lesson/board/group data.
// This is purely the real-time "is it live right now" flag layered on top.
