// LiveBroadcastListener — mounted once in AppShell.
// Shows a toast to every STUDENT the instant a class goes live, driven by
// the single unambiguous signal in live-broadcast.ts. Unlike the older
// invitation-based "lesson_start" notification (still sent for a
// belt-and-suspenders in-app record, see live-sessions.ts), this doesn't
// depend on the student having been online at the exact moment the
// teacher clicked Start — it fires for anyone who becomes online (or is
// already online) while the broadcast is active, exactly once per
// broadcast instance.
